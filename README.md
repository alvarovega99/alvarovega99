# Hi, I'm Alvaro Vega ðŸ‘‹ ðŸ’»
I am a back-end developer with experience in AWS, specializing in Node.js and Python. I am passionate about working in the cloud and automating processes to improve efficiency and reduce costs. I have worked on designing, implementing, and maintaining scalable and robust cloud systems using AWS tools such as Lambda, EC2, S3, and RDS. I have skills in programming in Node.js and Python, and experience with version control tools like Git. I am always looking for new opportunities to improve my skills and knowledge in the cloud and enhance the quality of my projects.
